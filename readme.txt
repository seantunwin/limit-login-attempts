=== Limit Login Attempts ===
Contributors: johanee
Tags: login, security, authentication
Requires at least: 2.5
Tested up to: 2.8.4
Stable tag: 1.4.1

Limit rate of login attempts, including by way of cookies, for each IP. Protects user login names from discovery. (BETA VERSION)

== Description ==

THIS IS A BETA VERSION!

Limit the number of login attempts possible both through normal login as well as (WordPress 2.7+) using auth cookies.

By default WordPress allows unlimited login attempts either through the login page or by sending special cookies. This allows passwords (or hashes) to be brute-force cracked with relative ease.

Limit Login Attempts blocks an Internet address from making further attempts after a specified limit on retries is reached, making a brute-force attack difficult or impossible.

Limit Login Attempts can also help you protect user login names from discovery. This includes (Wordpress 2.6.5+) optional restrictions on password reset attempts for privileged users and rate limit on new user registrations.

* Limit the number of retry attempts when logging in (for each IP). Fully customizable

== Installation ==

1. Download and extract plugin files to a folder in your wp-content/plugin directory.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is this option about site connection and reverse proxy? =

A reverse proxy is a server in between the site and the Internet (perhaps handling caching or load-balancing). This makes getting the correct client IP to block slightly more complicated.

The option default to NOT being behind a proxy -- which should be by far the common case.

= How do I know if my site is behind a reverse proxy? =

You probably are not or you would know. We show a pretty good guess on the option page. Set the option using this unless you are sure you know better.

= I locked myself out testing this thing, what do I do? =

Either wait, or:

If you have ftp / ssh access to the site rename the file "wp-content/plugins/limit-login-attempts/limit-login-attempts.php" to deactivate the plugin.

If you have access to the database (for example through phpMyAdmin) you can clear the limit_login_lockouts option in the wordpress options table. In a default setup this would work: "UPDATE wp_options SET option_value = '' WHERE option_name = 'limit_login_lockouts'"

= Why the privileged users list? Why are some names marked? =

These are the various names WordPress has for each user. To increase security the login name should not be the same as any of the others as they can be discovered in various ways.

= What is URL Name / "nicename"? =

"Nicename" is what WordPress calls it (internally). It is constructed directly from the login name and is used in the public author archive url, default comment template (as a comment class) and default post template (as a post class). This means that if you change it the old author archive url will no longer work.

= I disabled password reset for administrators and forgot my password, what do I do? =

If you have ftp / ssh access look at the answer regarding being locked out above.

If you have access to the database (for example through phpMyAdmin) you can clear the limit_login_reset_min_role option in the wordpress options table. In a default setup this would work: "UPDATE wp_options SET option_value = '' WHERE option_name = 'limit_login_reset_min_role'"
